### Project description

POMSimulator is a software for predicting the aqueous speciation and self-assembly mechanism of polyoxometalates (POMs). This tool helps researchers understand the complex chemistry of these molecular metal oxide clusters in solution.

### Features

* Prediction of POM speciation in aqueous solutions
* Simulation of self-assembly mechanisms
* Analysis of pH-dependent behavior
* Visualization of speciation diagrams
* Export of simulation results in various formats

### Methods

The software implements several computational methods:

* Thermodynamic modeling of equilibrium reactions
* Density functional theory calculations for structure optimization
* Machine learning algorithms for pattern recognition in speciation data

### Applications

POMSimulator can be used in various fields:

* Materials science
* Nanotechnology
* Inorganic synthesis

### Technical Details
The software is written in Python with a modular architecture that allows for easy extension and customization. It uses NumPy and SciPy for numerical calculations, Matplotlib for visualization.
