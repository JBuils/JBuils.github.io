title: "POMSimulator 2.0.0"
excerpt: "POMSimulator is a software for predicting the aqueous speciation and self-assembly mechanism of polyoxometalates. Based on a pure Python framework, the method generates reaction maps using Graph Theory, and solves the non-linear equations related to the speciation models. The software creates a collection of formation constants for all the species in the simulation, and a list of the chemical reactions. The package also contains a set of python scripts for analysing and plotting this data."
