title: "POMsGibbsNet"
excerpt: "GibbsNet is a software based on the AABBA kernel for the prediction of thermodynamic parameters of polyoxometalates. The method starts by generating a collection of graphs from DFT calculations to perform the AABBA autocorrelations. The resulting vectors are fed into a NN for the prediction of thermodynamic properties. This package works in synergy with POMSimulator using the automatic CRN exploration in the method, to further validate results."
