I am a **computational chemist** from Mallorca, Spain. I began my academic
journey by earning a Bachelor's Degree in Chemistry from the [University of
the Balearic Islands](https://www.uib.es). During this period, I developed a strong interest in
**inorganic chemistry** and **computational inorganic chemistry**, which led me
to pursue a Master's Degree in Chemical Science and Technology at the
same institution, where I had the opportunity to work under the supervision
of **Prof. Àngel Terrón Homar**.

Driven by my growing interest in theoretical modelling, I started my PhD in
Chemical Science and Technology at Rovira i Virgili University (URV), in the
Inorganic and Physical Chemistry Department. My doctoral research,
supervised by **Prof. Carles Bo Jané** and **Dr. Mireia Segado Centellas**, focused
on **polyoxometalates (POMs)** was entitled [**“Enhancing POMSimulator
Applications in Heteropolyoxometalates: A Statistical and Data-Driven
Approach”**](https://www.tesisenred.net/handle/10803/693464). I successfully defended my thesis in December 2024, earning an
**"Excellent Cum Laude"** distinction along with the **International Mention**.

During my PhD, I became deeply involved in the development of **open-
source** tools for the modelling of polyoxometalates. I contributed
significantly to the development of [**POMSimulator**](https://github.com/petrusen/pomsimulator), a tool for predicting
aqueous speciation and self-assembly mechanisms of POMs. I also led the
development of [**POMs-GibbsNet**](https://gitlab.com/jbuils/poms-gibbsnet), a platform that combines DFT results with
deep neural networks for thermodynamic property predictions. In this same
project, I generated a database containing [**thousands of polyoxometalates**](iochem-collection).

In early 2024, I completed a three-month international research stay at the
University of Oslo, working in the [**Hylleraas Centre of Excellence for
Quantum Molecular Sciences**](https://www.mn.uio.no/hylleraas/english/) under the guidance of **Prof. David Balcells**.
There, I explored the integration of machine learning algorithms with DFT
calculations to predict the thermodynamic properties of
polyoxometalates—an experience that expanded my expertise in data
science and its applications in theoretical chemistry, leading to the
development of the **POMS-GibbsNet**.

After completing my PhD, I continued at ICIQ as a **postdoctoral researcher**,
where I am currently working. My research has focused on the simulation
of **Complex Reaction Networks (CRN)** in aqueous environments, particularly
involving molybdenum-based POMs. I have authored nine peer-reviewed
articles, including **five in Q1 journals**, with one being recognized as an
**"Editor's Choice"**. My work has attracted more than 60 citations and
contributed to advancing computational methods in **inorganic chemistry**.

Throughout my academic journey, I have presented my research in
numerous **national and international conferences**, including **EuChemS,
ESPA or ICCC**. I have also contributed to competitive national research
projects, such as those funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science and the
Severo Ochoa Excellence Program. Furthermore, I have supervised and
mentored early-career researchers, including PhD students conducting
secondments at ICIQ.

My scientific career has been shaped by a strong foundation in
**computational and inorganic chemistry**, a passion for **open science**, and a
commitment to advancing our understanding of **complex molecular
systems** through interdisciplinary collaboration.
